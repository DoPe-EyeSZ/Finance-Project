                <h3 class="function-title">💰 Deposit</h3>
                <p>Add money directly to a specific expense category without creating an entry. Useful for adding bonus money, gifts, or transferring funds from outside sources.</p>
                <div class="step-example">Example: Depositing $100 directly into Savings adds money only to that category.</div>

                <p>Move money from one expense category to another. This is helpful when you need to reallocate funds based on changing priorities.</p>
                <div class="step-example">Example: Moving $50 from Food to Gas when you need extra driving money.</div>

        <div class="expense-block">
            <h3 class="expense-name-small">What Are Entries?</h3>
            <p>Entries represent income periods—like your paycheck or monthly budget. Each entry shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total income added</li>
                <li>How that income was automatically split across your expense categories</li>
                <li>Money you spent from each category</li>
                <li>Leftover money not assigned to any expense</li>
                <li>Your total balance for that specific entry</li>
                <li>How much you saved</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="function-sections">
            <div class="function-section">
                <h3 class="function-title">💵 Income</h3>
                <p>The total amount of money you earned for this entry. It automatically divides across your expense categories based on their percentages.</p>
                <div class="step-example">Example: $1,000 income × 40% Rent = $400 allocated to Rent.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="function-section">
                <h3 class="function-title">💳 Debit Spending</h3>
                <p>Money spent immediately—reduces your available balance right away. Use this for cash, debit card purchases, or any spending that comes out of your account now.</p>
                <div class="step-example">Example: Buying $50 in groceries with debit lowers your Food category by $50 instantly.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="function-section">
                <h3 class="function-title">💳 Credit Spending</h3>
                <p>Purchases made on credit that haven't been paid yet. This is tracked separately and doesn't reduce your available money until you actually pay it off.</p>
                <div class="step-example">Example: $200 on a credit card shows as unpaid credit, not as spent money yet.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="function-section">
                <h3 class="function-title">💰 Deposits</h3>
                <p>Extra money added to a specific expense category within this entry. Different from the Deposit feature in Manage Expenses—this one ties to a specific entry.</p>
                <div class="step-example">Example: Adding $30 extra into your Gas expense for a road trip.</div>
            </div>
